# Chess Timer

My first Android app - A simple Chess Timer available in the play store.  [Source](https://github.com/johnwilde/AndroidChessClock/) [Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=johnwilde.androidchessclock)

Occasionally I update this when I feel like experimenting with a something new.  I recently added some new features in Kotlin to help me learn the language.
