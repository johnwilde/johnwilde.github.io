Most of my work was done at the [MIT Hobby Shop](https://studentlife.mit.edu/hobbyshop) which is a wonderful resource for all members of the MIT community.  If you are interested in learning woodworking I recommend Tage Frid's [classic texts](https://www.amazon.com/Tage-Teaches-Woodworking-step---step/dp/1561580686/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1309988135&sr=8-1) on Joinery and Design - they cover just about everything with good, practical advice. [woodgears.ca](http://woodgears.ca/) is a great online resource, especially if you are interested in building your own woodworking machinery.
